Deep Dive Alumni Python Workshop (Dec 2nd, 2017)
===

Prework
---

Download and install Anaconda w/ Python 3.6

[https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux]

Download the Anaconda Cheat Sheet in case you need it.  It has some tips for working with Anaconda, but we hopefully won't need it.

Plan
---

Kris will be presenting an introduction on Python, using [http://www.learnpython.org] as the lesson template.

We will then do an intro to Machine Learning, focusing primarily on decision trees and hopefully a little time to talk about neural networks.  The focus will be focused on understanding how some ML algorithms work, and how to use the Scikit Learn library.

We will be going through the Intro to Machine Learning [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html], Decision Trees using Scikit Learn [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html], and hopefully start in on Neural Networks using Skikit Learn [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html]
